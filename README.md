# RF spectra analysis

MATLAB code to plot local RF spectra across an atomic cloud in a hybrid trap.

Atoms are transferred to state 3 with an RF pulse. Since k_F varies across the cloud, the RF transfer fraction depends on the position inside the cloud. Varying the RF frequency results in 'bands' of atoms in equipotential volumes transferred and visible in the arrival images (see above).
